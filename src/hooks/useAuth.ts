 * Thin re-export so components can import from "@/hooks/useAuth".

 * both as a named export and as the default export to match different import styles.
 *
 * If your AuthContext does not export a `useAuth` hook, this will throw a build-time
 * or runtime error — in that case paste the first ~120 lines of
 * src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx and I will adapt this wrapper accordingly.
